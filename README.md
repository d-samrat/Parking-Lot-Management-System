# Parking Lot Management System


Low-Level Design implementation of a Parking Lot Management System using Java.

This project demonstrates:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Data Structures (HashMap, PriorityQueue)

- Strategy Pattern

- Clean architecture \& separation of concerns


---


## Architecture

- ParkingLot → Contains multiple ParkingFloor

- ParkingFloor → Manages ParkingSpot

- ParkingSpot → Abstract class (Small, Medium, Large)

- Vehicle → Abstract class (Car, Bike, Truck)

- ParkingStrategy → Spot allocation logic

- PricingStrategy → Billing logic


---


## Features

- Multi-floor parking

- Vehicle-based spot compatibility

- Strategy-based spot allocation

- Strategy-based billing

- Entry \& Exit flow

- Exception handling


---


## Concepts Used

- Abstraction

- Inheritance

- Polymorphism

- Composition

- Strategy Pattern

- HashMap

- PriorityQueue

- Custom Exceptions


---


## How to Run
